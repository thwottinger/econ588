    "The means of the multivariate normal distribution from which X will be sampled are all 0. The error term follows a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a variance of 400.\n",
    "This model provides a series of problems for normal (OLS) estimation. First, the number of predictors is high and many of those predictors have no effect on y. Second, the predictors are correlated with each-other. <br />\n",
